# Pandas-HW

In this activity I evaluated video game user data. Using python pandas to group the data by different factors, age, gender, item purchase etcâ€¦ from that I was able to create player demographics , number of users per gender / age range.  Was able to identify the most purchased ingame items. I was able to determine Possible revenue growth areas, such as the female players on percentage bases were making ingame purchases on par with male players yet female group was much smaller than the male. If ingame items could be targeted and towards that partricular user group with possible incentives the company could possibly see revenue growth from additional ingame purchases.
